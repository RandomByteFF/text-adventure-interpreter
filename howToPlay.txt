You can always use the "look around" command when lost. Always type in lower case, enter other rooms with "enter <roomname>" or "go to <roomname>". Use objects with the "use <object>" command, pick up objects with the "pick up <object>" command and use them on other objects with the "use <object> on <object>" command. Save game with the save game command. There is always a chance to use unique commands. DO NOT EVER RESIZE THE WINDOW!
